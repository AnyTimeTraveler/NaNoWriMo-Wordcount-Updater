# NaNoWriMo Updater

A small java program that automatically updates your [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) wordcount while you write.

### Supported Filetypes:
 - TXT
 - RTF
 - ODT
 - DOC
 - DOCX

### Features:
 - Remember the file you were working on
 - Remember your credentials (optional) (careful, credentials are stored in plain text)
 - Remembers wordcounts between restarts

The program mimics the same procedure that you would undergo when updating your wordcount on the website, but reduces the strain on their servers a lot, since it doesn't load images or JavaScript from their webpages.
