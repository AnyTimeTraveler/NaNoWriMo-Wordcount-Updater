# NaNoWriMo Updater

A small java program that automatically updates your [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) wordcount while you write.

### Supported Filetypes:
 - TXT
 - RTF
 - ODT
 - DOC
 - DOCX

### Features:
 - Remember the file you were working on
 - Remember your credentials (optional) (careful, credentials are stored in plain text)
 - Remembers wordcounts between restarts

The program mimics the same procedure that you would undergo when updating your wordcount on the website, but reduces the strain on their servers a lot, since it doesn't load images or JavaScript from their webpages.

#License

This project uses The unlicense.
This essentially means you are free to do anything with it.
It is, however, highly appreciated if you make your version of the program publicly available.
