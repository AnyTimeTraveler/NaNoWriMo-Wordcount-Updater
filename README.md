# NaNoWriMo Tracker

A small program that tracks your writing progress and can update your [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) wordcount while you write.

### Supported Filetypes
 - Text Files (TXT, RTF)
 - Word Documents (ODT, DOC, DOCX)
 - Scrivener Projects (SCRIV)
 - More upon request

### Features
 - Updates your wordcount on the [NaNoWriMo website](https://nanowrimo.org/)
 - Keeps track of your writing progress
 - Autodetects your document type
 - Specify your own custom wordgoals
 
### Planned Features
 - Fancy charts to show your writing progress
 - Private Servers, so you can use the tool also outside of [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/)

Special Thanks to [Kevin Alberts](https://github.com/Kurocon) for the implementation of the NaNoWriMo-API.
